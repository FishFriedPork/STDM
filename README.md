# STDM
## The function of each python document:
1. DataPrecessing.py: It will get average AQI from raw data
2. GlobalMoran.py: It will compute Global moran I's and print it 
3. locationplot.py:It will scatter air quality monitor in the map according to their location
4. LSTM.py: It will use LSTM to predict all station AQI in the future and give an excel and figure
5. plot2022BJ: It will plot Beijing AQI according to spatial interpolation
6. STARIMA.R: It will predict AQI in the future and give a figuer
7. STPACF_STACF.R: It will draw the picture of STPACF_STACF in different time lag
8. Timeplot.py: give a figure of 5 different AQI in Beijing
9. LSTM2025plot.py: Plot spatial interpolation LSTM predicted AQI Map on 2025/6/1
10. STARIMA2025plot.py: Plot spatial interpolation STARIMA predicted AQI Map on 2025/6/1

## _**Mention: Please change the path of each document when running the code because the path used in code is absolute path!!!**_
